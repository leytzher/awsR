Hang to dry in the sunshine. Do not put your mat in the washing machine- it may break the machine and ruin your mat. <p><p> <b>To Store:</b><br> Roll your Black Mat PRO with the top side (fabric-finish) facing outwards. This keeps the corners of the mat flat when practicing. <p><br> <b>To Break In:</b><br> The surface texture of the Black Mat PRO improves with use. Our customers have found that the best way to break in their mat is to use it on a daily basis. Another trick is to sprinkle coarse sea salt over your mat, scrub it down with a sponge, and air dry in the sunshine. <p> <b>Manduka's Green Mission</b><br> Manduka PRO series yoga mats, designed to last a lifetime (or two), curb the amount of PVC mats that enter landfills every year and reduces overall mat consumption. Also, during the manufacturing of most PVC products, toxic emissions may be released into the air. However, PRO series mats are manufactured through a process that ensures no toxic emissions are released into the atmosphere. The Black Mat PRO is certified safe for human contact by OEKO-TEX, an environmental certification agency in Europe for the textile industry. <p>"

"Bean Yoga Mat Extra Thick 1/4 inch (6mm), Extra Long 72 inch, Premium Sticky Mat, Non-Toxic SGS certified - Royal Blue","<p>Yoga Monster Mat goes Eco! For those who want a more eco-friendly mat, our fantastic Yoga Monster Mat is now environmentally friendly. Our yoga mat is made of PER (Polymer Environmental Resin), which is a unique material that is sensitive to the environment and your health. This mat does not contain toxic phthalates, dioxins and furans, phenal, or heavy metals and has a ecologically safer method of production which is better for the workers and the environment - and most importantly it performs great for all types of yoga with excellent traction and cushion! </p> 
<p>Why should you be concerned about exposure to Phthalates? Because phthalates have been linked to a variety of health problems including endocrine disruption, obesity, diabetes and allergies. Studies from many continents indicate serious toxicity and health problems due to phthalate plastizers found in consumer products. Common plastics, such as pvc foam used in typical yoga mats can contain 10% to 60% phthalates. Phthalates migrate to the surface of the mat over time and use which increases phthalate concentration on the yoga mat surface. </p> 
<p>Our Yoga Monster Mats are SGS certified tested to non-measurable levels and far exceed the strict European phthalate standards. Using our Yoga Monster mat you can forget about phthalates and heavy metals and simply relax and enjoy your yoga practice.</p>"
